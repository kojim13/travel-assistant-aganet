### Prompt Engineering Summary

- I use **role prompting** to guide the LLM as a helpful travel assistant.
- Each domain-specific agent (destination, packing, attractions) has tailored system prompts to set behavior expectations.
- I experimented with **"chain of thought" prompting** to help the LLM reason step-by-step in suggestions (e.g., planning based on weather, destination type).
- While external data integration (like weather APIs) was planned, due to time limitations, I focused instead on simulating decisions based on assumed data.
- I prioritized **natural conversation flow** and **concise, actionable responses**, iterating on prompt wording for clarity and tone.
